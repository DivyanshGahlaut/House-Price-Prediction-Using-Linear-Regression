*Project Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on its key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. Using a linear regression algorithm, we establish a relationship between these independent variables and the target variable, i.e., the price of the house. The model is trained and tested on a dataset collected from Kaggle, which contains real estate data including property size and other relevant attributes. This project serves as a practical demonstration of applying supervised learning for regression problems in the real estate domain.

*Tools & Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation

numpy for numerical computations

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

scikit-learn for building and evaluating the linear regression model

Platform: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Dataset Source: Kaggle (House Price Dataset)

*How It Works:

1.Data Collection:
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and contains several attributes related to houses, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and price.

2.Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Checked for and handled missing values if any.

Selected relevant features: square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.

The target variable is the price.

3.Data Visualization:

Plotted scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to understand relationships between features.

Visualized data distributions to detect outliers and skewness.

4.Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Applied Linear Regression from scikit-learn to train the model on the training data.

Fitted the model to learn the relationship between the input features and the house price.

5.Model Evaluation:

Predicted house prices on the test set.

Evaluated performance using metrics like R-squared score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Visualized the prediction vs actual values to assess model accuracy.

6.Result Interpretation:

The model was able to identify trends and provide reasonably accurate predictions of house prices based on the provided features.
